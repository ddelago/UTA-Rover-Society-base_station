Steps to get Base Station and Odroid running with ROS

- Navigate to start_scripts directory for Base Staion
- To SSH into odroid, use this script:
sh odroid_ssh.sh
- In new terminal, start base station controls:
sh start_base_station.sh

Odroid: 
- Navigate to start_scripts directory for Odroid
- Start roscore and Arduino communications:
sh start_roscore_and_roscoms.sh

 - Start GPS: 
   rosrun nmea_navsat_driver nmea_serial_driver _port:=/dev/ttyACM# _baud:=38400
   ON BASESTATION: rosrun random_gps_publisher gps_publisher
 - Start IMU:
   rosrun myahrs_driver myahrs_driver _port:=/dev/ttyACM#    OR
   roslaunch myahrs_driver myahrs_driver.launch
 - Start Cameras:
   rosrun rqt_example_cpp opencv_test 0
 - rosrun serial_communication serial_communication.py

On Base Station:
 - Start rqt and run gps and Rviz for IMU 
 - NOTE: When you try to zoom in on the gps on OpenStreetMap View, It zooms out if you zoom in too far,
   Just keep zooming back in after it zooms out and it will work after a few trys
