start_controls.launch:
-Creates nodes: controller_raw, joystick_raw
-This uses 2 different joy nodes for the 2 controllers and gets 
 the raw input. 
-Starts nodes: controller, joystick, rosToArduino

controller.cpp:
-Creates node : controller
-Subscribes to: controller_raw
-Publishes to : cmd_vel, others as needed
-The drive system is similar to a videogame. Right trigger accelerates,
 left trigger decelerates, and left stick is steering. 

joystick.cpp:
-Creates node : joystick
-Subscribes to: joystick_raw 
-Publishes to : None Yet, Waiting for IK 

rosToArduino.py:
-Creates node : rosToArduino
-Subscribes to: cmd_vel, and others to be sent to arduino
-Publishes to : None, it writes to serial for arduino
-Make Executable: chmod +x rosToArduino.py
